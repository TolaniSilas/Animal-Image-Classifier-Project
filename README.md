# Image Classification Task

This project involves building a machine learning model to classify images of four different animals. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and a labeled dataset of animal images, the CNN model was trained on images of four animals, aiming to accurately identify the classes of animals depicted in new images. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the capabilities of machine learning in image classification and to provide a practical example of how machine learning can be applied to real-world problems.


## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is not a real dataset, but an image dataset of four classes of animals from Microsoft Azure Safari Challenge. 


## Features
- Image Data Upload: Easily upload exported images of animals.

- Confidence Score: Display confidence scores for predicted classes.

- Feedback: Accept feedback messages from users about the web app.

- And a Lot More.
